## 🚀 What I do  
I lead data-science and AI initiatives that move business needles, scale operational systems, and empower people-centric analytics. My focus areas:
- Building **production ML/AI systems** from data ingestion through deployment and monitoring.  
- Applying NLP, GenAI & Agentic-AI to real-world domains (finance, HR, procurement) to surface insights and automate decisions.  
- Driving measurable business impact (e.g., 25 % reduction in verification time, improved classification accuracy, faster decision cycles).  
- Mentoring teams, collaborating with stakeholders (directors, VPs), and translating strategy into analytics delivery.

## 📊 My Impact  
- Designed and developed multiple Agentic AI and GenAI solutions to meet rapidly changing business demands across financial, HR, and operational workflows.
- Led end-to-end delivery of production-grade ML systems, from data engineering to model deployment and performance monitoring.
- Built scalable MLOps pipelines with automated retraining, data-drift detection, and real-time model monitoring to ensure long-term reliability.
- Architected NLP-driven automation frameworks that improved information retrieval, reduced processing times, and enhanced decision speed across teams.
- Created analytics and AI accelerators that streamlined workflows, reducing manual effort and increasing process efficiency.
- Collaborated with directors, VPs, and cross-functional stakeholders to shape AI strategy, define success metrics, and ensure measurable business outcomes.
- Mentored data scientists and engineers, establishing best practices for model development, evaluation, and operationalisation.
- Delivered explainable, business-aligned machine learning solutions that improved insights visibility, forecasting accuracy, and operational transparency.

## 🎯 What I’m Exploring Now  
- Agentic AI systems for workflow automation and orchestration.  
- Advances in large-language-model fine-tuning for domain-specific use-cases (HR/People Analytics).  
- Explainable AI and monitoring frameworks for production systems (bias detection, drift).  
- Mentorship frameworks and team scaling in analytics organisations.
